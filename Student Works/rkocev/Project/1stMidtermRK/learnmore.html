        <h1>Tic Tac Toe</h1>
        <p>
            <b>Tic-tac-toe</b> or Xs and Os is a paper-and-pencil game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the
            spaces
            in a 3×3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or
            diagonal
            row is the winner.
            The following example game is won by the first player, X: <br><img src="tic.jpg"> <br>  <!-- image between the text paragraphs -->

            Players soon discover that the best play from both parties leads to a draw. Hence, tic-tac-toe is most often
            played by young children, who often have not yet discovered the optimal strategy.
            Because of the simplicity of tic-tac-toe, it is often used as a pedagogical tool for teaching the concepts
            of
            good sportsmanship and the branch of artificial intelligence that deals with the searching of game trees. It
            is
            straightforward to write a computer program to play tic-tac-toe perfectly or to enumerate the 765
            essentially
            different positions (the state space complexity) or the 26,830 possible games up to rotations and
            reflections
            (the game tree complexity) on this space.
            The game can be generalized to an m,n,k-game in which two players alternate placing stones of their own
            color on
            an m×n board, with the goal of getting k of their own color in a row. Tic-tac-toe is the (3,3,3)-game.
            Harary's
            generalized tic-tac-toe is an even broader generalization of tic-tac-toe. It can also be generalized as a nd
            game. Tic-tac-toe is the game where n equals 3 and d equals 2. If played optimally by both players, the game
            always ends in a draw, making tic-tac-toe a futile game.

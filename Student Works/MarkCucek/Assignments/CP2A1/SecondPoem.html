        <h3>Stanza 1</h3>
        <p>Thou still unravish’d bride of quietness,<br>
Thou foster-child of silence and slow time,<br>
Sylvan historian, who canst thus express<br>
A flowery tale more sweetly than our rhyme:<br>
What leaf-fring’d legend haunts about thy shape<br>
Of deities or mortals, or of both,<br>
In Tempe or the dales of Arcady?<br>
What men or gods are these? What maidens loth?<br>
What mad pursuit? What struggle to escape?<br>
What pipes and timbrels? What wild ecstasy?</p>

        <h3>Stanza 2</h3>
        <p>Heard melodies are sweet, but those unheard<br>
Are sweeter; therefore, ye soft pipes, play on;<br>
Not to the sensual ear, but, more endear’d,<br>
Pipe to the spirit ditties of no tone:<br>
Fair youth, beneath the trees, thou canst not leave<br>
Thy song, nor ever can those trees be bare;<br>
Bold Lover, never, never canst thou kiss,<br>
Though winning near the goal yet, do not grieve;<br>
She cannot fade, though thou hast not thy bliss,<br>
For ever wilt thou love, and she be fair!</p>

        <h3>Stanza 3</h3>
        <p>Ah, happy, happy boughs! that cannot shed<br>
Your leaves, nor ever bid the Spring adieu;<br>
And, happy melodist, unwearied,<br>
For ever piping songs for ever new;<br>
More happy love! more happy, happy love!<br>
For ever warm and still to be enjoy’d,<br>
For ever panting, and for ever young;<br>
All breathing human passion far above,<br>
That leaves a heart high-sorrowful and cloy’d,<br>
A burning forehead, and a parching tongue.</p>

        <h3>Stanza 4</h3>
        <p>Who are these coming to the sacrifice?<br>
To what green altar, O mysterious priest,<br>
Lead’st thou that heifer lowing at the skies,<br>
And all her silken flanks with garlands drest?<br>
What little town by river or sea shore,<br>
Or mountain-built with peaceful citadel,<br>
Is emptied of this folk, this pious morn?<br>
And, little town, thy streets for evermore<br>
Will silent be; and not a soul to tell<br>
Why thou art desolate, can e’er return.</p>

        <h3>Stanza 5</h3>
        <p>O Attic shape! Fair attitude! with brede<br>
Of marble men and maidens overwrought,<br>
With forest branches and the trodden weed;<br>
Thou, silent form, dost tease us out of thought<br>
As doth eternity: Cold Pastoral!<br>
When old age shall this generation waste,<br>
Thou shalt remain, in midst of other woe<br>
Than ours, a friend to man, to whom thou say’st,<br>
“Beauty is truth, truth beauty,—that is all<br>
Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.”</p>

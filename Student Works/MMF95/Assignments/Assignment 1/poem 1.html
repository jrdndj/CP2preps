				From off a hill whose concave womb reworded
				A plaintful story from a sistering vale,
				My spirits to attend this double voice accorded,
				And down I laid to list the sad-tuned tale;
				Ere long espied a fickle maid full pale,
				Tearing of papers, breaking rings a-twain,
				Storming her world with sorrow's wind and rain.

				Upon her head a platted hive of straw,
				Which fortified her visage from the sun,
				Whereon the thought might think sometime it saw
				The carcass of beauty spent and done:
				Time had not scythed all that youth begun,
				Nor youth all quit; but, spite of heaven's fell rage,
				Some beauty peep'd through lattice of sear'd age.

				Often did she heave her napkin to her eyne,
				Which on it had conceited characters,
				Laundering the silken figures in the brine
				That season'd woe had pelleted in tears,
				And often reading what contents it bears;
				As often shrieking undistinguish'd woe,
				In clamours of all size, both high and low.

				Sometimes her levell'd eyes their carriage ride,
				As they did battery to the spheres intend;
				Sometime diverted their poor balls are tied
				To the orbed earth; sometimes they do extend
				Their view right on; anon their gazes lend
				To every place at once, and, nowhere fix'd,
				The mind and sight distractedly commix'd.

<pre>
				Her hair, nor loose nor tied in formal plat,
				Proclaim'd in her a careless hand of pride
				For some, untuck'd, descended her sheaved hat,
				Hanging her pale and pined cheek beside;
				Some in her threaden fillet still did bide,
				And true to bondage would not break from thence,
				Though slackly braided in loose negligence.

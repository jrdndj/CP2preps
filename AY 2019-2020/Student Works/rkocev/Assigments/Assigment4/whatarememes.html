            <p>A meme is an idea, behavior, or style that spreads by means of imitation from person to person within a
                culture—often
                with the aim of conveying a particular phenomenon, theme, or meaning represented by the meme. A meme
                acts as a unit for carrying cultural ideas,
                symbols, or practices, that can be transmitted from one mind to another through writing, speech,
                gestures, rituals, or other imitable phenomena
                with a mimicked theme. Supporters of the concept regard memes as cultural analogues to genes in that
                they self-replicate, mutate, and respond to
                selective pressures. Proponents theorize that memes are a viral phenomenon that may evolve by
                natural selection in a manner analogous to that of
                biological evolution. Memes do this through the processes of variation, mutation, competition, and
                inheritance, each of which influences a meme's
                reproductive success. Memes spread through the behavior that they generate in their hosts. Memes
                that propagate less prolifically may become extinct,
                while others may survive, spread, and (for better or for worse) mutate. Memes that replicate most
                effectively enjoy more success, and some may replicate
                effectively even when they prove to be detrimental to the welfare of their hosts. A field of study
                called memetics arose in the 1990s to explore
                the concepts and transmission of memes in terms of an evolutionary model. Criticism from a variety
                of fronts has challenged the notion that academic
                study can examine memes empirically. However, developments in neuroimaging may make empirical study
                possible. Some commentators in the social sciences
                question the idea that one can meaningfully categorize culture in terms of discrete units, and are
                especially critical of the biological nature of the
                theory's underpinnings. Others have argued that this use of the term is the result of a
                misunderstanding of the original proposal. The word meme is a
                neologism coined by Richard Dawkins. It originated from Dawkins's 1976 book The Selfish Gene.
                Dawkins's own position is somewhat ambiguous: he welcomed
                N. K. Humphrey's suggestion that "memes should be considered as living structures, not just
                metaphorically" and proposed to regard memes as "physically
                residing in the brain". Later, he argued that his original intentions, presumably before his
                approval of Humphrey's opinion, had been simpler.

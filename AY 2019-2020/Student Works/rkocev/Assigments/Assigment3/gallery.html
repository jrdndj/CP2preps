                        of the Ring. Variants of the phrase are often used in image macros featuring Mordor,

                        originally says the line in the film.</th>

                        humanoid character erroneously identifies a butterfly as a pigeon. On Tumblr, the quote, along
                        with a reaction image of the scene featuring the English-translated subtitle, is widely used to
                        express utter confusion.</th>

                        the image was used as a reaction image paired with captions where a
                        set-up leads to a predictable outcome that nevertheless leaves one surprised.

                        February 2018, the photograph has been turned into an exploitable template for online parodies.
